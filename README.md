# Project3-Supervised-Learning-Classification-Methods

The average career length of a National Basketball Association (NBA) player is close to 5 years1. This means
that, on average, players sign two contracts with one (or more) team(s) during their career. This happens
since their first contract can last up to 3 years and their second contract up to 4 years. During their first
year into the NBA, these players are known as rookies. For the majority of the players; their rookie year is
considered to be a year of ups and downs where they mainly try to prove themselves to their opponents (and
their teammates). For most of the rookies, this is their first time being a part of a professional team and the
differences between college basketball (or European basketball) and NBA basketball are huge.


In this project we predict whether a basketball player will play more than 5 seasons in the NBA by just looking at their statistics from their rookie seasons.
